# General API Information #

## Schema ##

All API access is over HTTP and starts with

    http://github.com/api/v2/:format

where `:format` is one of 'json', 'xml' or 'yaml', specifying what the
response data should be formatted in.  For all of the rest of this
documentation, we will be leaving off that part, since it is the same
for every API call.

**Note:** XML and YAML support is currently deprecated.  Existing API calls 
will continue to support it, but new API features will only support JSON.

## Authentication ##

[OAuth](/p/oauth.html) is the preferred authentication method because tokens can be
limited to specific types of data, and can be revoked by users at any
time.

You can use HTTP Basic Auth to authenticate as a GitHub user.  If you want to pass your API token instead, add "/token" to the Basic Auth username.  Note that all requests that need authentication should include the Authentication header.  Unauthenticated requests will return 404 to prevent any sort of private information leakage.

You may also pass `login` and `token` to any URL. Note that this method
of authentication is deprecated.

Several of the calls will return extra data if you are authenticated
as a user that owns the repository or has access to it as a
collaborator.  For example, a call to get information on one of your
private repositories would be:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -u "schacon:PASSWORD" \
  http://github.com/api/v2/json/user/show/schacon | jsonpretty
{
  "user": {
    "company": "GitHub",
    "name": "Scott Chacon",
    "following_count": 11,
    "blog": "http:\/\/scottchacon.com",
    "public_repo_count": 52,
    "public_gist_count": 45,
    "disk_usage": 294392,
    "collaborators": 3,
    "plan": {
      "name": "small",
      "collaborators": 5,
      "space": 1228800,
      "private_repos": 10
    },
    "id": 70,
    "owned_private_repo_count": 10,
    "total_private_repo_count": 14,
    "private_gist_count": 11,
    "login": "schacon",
    "followers_count": 182,
    "created_at": "2008\/01\/27 09:19:28 -0800",
    "email": "schacon@gmail.com",
    "location": "Redwood City, CA"
  }
}
</pre>

Here's a Basic Auth example using the API Token:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -u "schacon/token:6ef8395fecf207165f1a82178ae1b984" \
  http://github.com/api/v2/json/user/show/schacon | jsonpretty
{
  "user": {...
</pre>

## Secure Access ##

You can access any API call over HTTPS, though public data can also be
accessed over HTTP.

## JSON callbacks ##

If you send a 'callback' variable to any call, it will wrap the result
JSON in that function, so you can automatically execute it.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/issues/list/schacon/simplegit/open?callback=myJsFunction
myJsFunction({"issues": [
{"user": "schacon",
"updated_at": "2009/04/17 16:19:02 -0700",
"body": "something",
"title": "new",
"number": 2,
"votes": 0,
"position": 1.0,
"created_at": "2009/04/17 16:18:50 -0700",
"state": "open"}
]});
</pre>

## Limitations ##

Currently we are limiting API calls to 60 per minute.  This may change
in the future, or possibly per user at some point, but if you try to
access the API more than 60 times in a minute, it will start giving
you "access denied" errors.
