# Pull Request API

API for accessing Pull Requests.  This API is considered **BETA**, file any
feedback in the [API forum](http://support.github.com/discussions/api).

## Creating a Pull Request

    /pulls/:user/:repo [POST]

You can create a Pull Request by posting these attributes:

* `pull[base]` - A String of the branch or commit SHA that you want your changes to be pulled to.
* `pull[head]` - A String of the branch or commit SHA of your changes.  Typically this will be a branch.  If the branch is in a fork of the original repository, specify the username first: "my-user:some-branch".
* `pull[title]` - The String title of the Pull Request (and the related Issue).
* `pull[body]` - The String body of the Pull Request.

Example: The user "smparkes" forks "technoweenie/faraday", and adds a new
feature to the "synchrony" branch.  This is how he could create the Pull
Request through the API:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -d "pull[base]=master" -d "pull[head]=smparkes:synchrony" \
  -d "pull[title]=..." -d "pull[body]=..." \
  https://github.com/api/v2/json/pulls/technoweenie/faraday
</pre>

You can replace `pull[title]` and `pull[body]` with `pull[issue]` to specify an existing Issue number on the source repository:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -d "pull[base]=master" -d "pull[head]=smparkes:synchrony" \
  -d "pull[issue]=15" \
  https://github.com/api/v2/json/pulls/technoweenie/faraday
</pre>

## Listing Pull Requests

You can list pull requests for any Repository that you can access.  If the
repository is private, supply your login credentials.

    /pulls/:user/:repo/:state

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/pulls/technoweenie/faraday

The Pull Request API uses a lot of fields from the Issue.  Fields like `title`, `body`, `number`, `labels`, etc, will match a similar Issues API call:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/issues/show/technoweenie/faraday/15
</pre>
Some Issue fields names that clash with Pull Request field names are prefixed
with `issue_`.  The `discussion` key lists all of the Commits, Issue Comments, and Commit Comments for this Pull Request.  The `discussion` key is only available when fetching a single Pull Request.

## Updating Pull Requests

Pull Requests themselves don't update, they merely track changes to Issues and
Commits.  See the [Issues API](/p/issues.html) for info on commenting on or
closing Pull Requests.  Issues and Pull Requests use the same identification
numbers.
